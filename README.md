# Geometrical Series (Pt. 1) ðŸ“–
This is a little and short research I tried to do years ago without success _(I was not so wise on mathematics)_. Its basically about this "classic" problem where you are given a grid and are asked about how many squares are there, counting every single square, whatever it is a single cell, a square formed by spanning multiple cells, or even the entire border of the grid. This is a **proof by example** approach where there is no mathematical formalism, but it is enough to get a valid formula.

This is hopefully the only edition of this approach. The second part, as the **_(Pt. 1)_** piece suggests, will be about a more formal way to proof this formula, and understand its geometrical meaning.
